export const TEXT_SECTION_TINKERER = `I've always had a fascination with how things, including websites and electronics, operate. My hobby of fixing mobile devices in my free time while attending school helped me land a job as a mobile technician. After that, I found myself working for a start-up in a more factory-like environment with countless automation opportunities. I eventually came up with a number of software tools for automation that minimise human error and boost throughput. That helped me land a position on the engineering team of the company, and the rest is history. I still enjoy creating things with my hands now, outside of work, and I've been working on small IoT projects and fixing an old sailboat.`
